Hello dear reader,

Recently I was browsing eBay to find a interesting case for my new tube power amplifier. For experiments and tests I have been using old equipment to case my projects. In this way I am reusing old equipment and save The Planet from electronic waste. I bought a Bush Acoustics AMP2025 amplifier. It has a low profile case with a lot of hals on top and bottom, which means it has a very good ventilation. Price was around Â£15 without postage.
The plan I had in mind is to remove all internals and host my own tube amplifier and use this lovely ventilated case and rest of the parts for other builds. 
When it comes home, I opened it and I was surprised of how good it was build! It have very clean design and all parts of the board are marked like: "Preamp, Power, Protect, Phono EQ, Input part..." etc. The left and right channel are marked and separate on the board. Audio signal comes from two twisted cables from the preamp to the power amp to each channel.
