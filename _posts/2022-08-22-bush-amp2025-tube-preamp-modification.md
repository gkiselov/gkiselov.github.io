Hello Dear reader,

Recently I was browsing eBay to find an interesting case for my new tube power amplifier. For experiments and tests I have been using old equipment to case my projects. In this way I am reusing old equipment and save The Planet from electronic waste. I bought a Bush Acoustics AMP2025 amplifier. It has a low profile case with a lot of holes on top and bottom, which means it has a very good ventilation. Price was around Â£15 without postage.
The plan I had in mind is to remove all internals and host my own tube amplifier and use this lovely ventilated case and rest of the parts for other builds. 
When it comes home, I opened it and I was surprised of how good it was build! It have very clean design and all parts of the board are marked like: "Preamp, Power, Protect, Phono EQ, Input part..." etc. The left and right channel are marked and separate on the board. Audio signal comes from two twisted cables from the preamp to the power amp to each channel.

Expired from [Lampizator website](http://www.lampizator.eu) I decide that this little amp is a perfect candidate to integrate a tube preamp. For the preamp I used 6J1 preamp kit bought from AliExpress.

or [this one](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DeZrpWb).

Preamp comes with all parts and schematic you can see on the website. Some variations of this kit comes with 470uF 35V electrolytic capacitors, others with 470uF 50V. This is important for my build, because I am using the power from the amp it's self to power the preamp. The amp works on center tapped +37,5V -37,5V and capacitors on 35V will not fit in this case.
